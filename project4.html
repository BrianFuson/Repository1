    <h3>Stress Installation</h3>
    <p>Stress was my installation for a workshop with Draw Down Books. We were tasked to create letterforms that utilized the Art and Architecture building at UTK uniquely. I ended up choosing the word “Stress” as it felt fitting because it was finals week at the time. The custom letterforms are inspired by blackletter and heavy metal music. I think of blackletter as a old and mysterious way of writing that when mixed with the spiky metal feeling, I believe that the forms fit their names. I wanted to cut out the letters themselves leaving the counterforms using the building to fill in the letters to further create the metaphor that the building creates stress. I then expanded these custom letterforms into a typeface. I wanted to embody stress throughout this project, and I believe it really comes through. This is my first ever published typeface. It is the typeface that I launched my type foundry, Fusion Type, with.</p>
