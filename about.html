    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hello. My name is Brian Fuson. I am currently enrolled in the Graphic Design program at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and am going to graduate in May of 2025. I am passionate about design itself from type to furniture design. Creating things is what drives me as a graphic designer. I thrive on figuring out solutions to difficult projects.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy typography from type design to type setting. I like to bring my work out of the computer and into the third dimension. I am eager to learn as I feel there is so many aspects of graphic design I want to explore. I enjoy exploring with my designs as I chalk each one of my projects up as an experiment to improve off of. Graphic design really is my passion and I am excited to create every day.</p>
