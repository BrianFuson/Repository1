    <h3>FRED UI</h3>
    <p>FRED stands for "Friendly Robot to End Dementia". For this research project, I was tasked with creating a user interface (UI) for this friendly helper. It is constructed with a screen in its body that allows interaction. Our team has three designers and each of us are designing a different style of UI. I was selected to design a minimal/professional interface. The audience is a challenging one as dementia deteriorates a persons ability to do everyday tasks. Limiting selections and having courtesy navigation helps aid in use. I took an approach of looking at children's devices for my reference as they promote learning and do not feel overly simple. I created several user flows as this is closer to a device rather than an application. The logo was constructed to feel professional and trustworthy. The colors reference the idea that purple unites all dementia patients, and I build the palette around that. Below is my draft that is going to be used in user testing in order to receive valuable feedback in supporting those with this inhibiting impairment.</p>
