    <h3>Monsters Made With Love</h3>
    <p>Monsters Made With Love is a Knoxville based creative workshop with a goal of therapeutic art. I attended one of the workshops and was later asked to create a brand standard/redesign for Laurie Kay. She only wanted to keep her logos as she had gained some brand recognizability with them. She did not have much unity from her website, fliers, and social media ads. When starting, I looked to common themes I thought of during the workshop. I came up with turning pieces of the monster kit into abstract shapes and graphics for a fun and modern look. I created a brand standard as a guide explaining the methodology behind each design choice. I later exported these assets into Canva and created poster templates so she can easily promote events.</p>
