    <h3>Manifesto Poster</h3>
    <p>This project is a personal Manifesto that utilizes new graphic designers as its audience. My concept for this project is to reassure young designers that anxiety is natural and is okay. When thinking of the future, it is scary. I took a literal approach to this when choosing my reference of the futurism movement. I wanted the overall feeling to embody the word “chaos”. I chose to use Futura as the body typeface, but created a mono-space typeface for this project's title as I wanted to create a nice lock up column look I eventually developed my concept away from that idea. For the final draft of this poster the GRDS class of 2025 traveled to Coke in Atlanta, Georgia as in 2022 this design team team developed a manifesto for the Coke brand. We received critique from the design team and I took this input and developed my poster to it’s final iteration. This was an extremely difficult project in both conceptual and methodical means. My manifesto poster poster was selected and shown in the UTK's annual student show for the month of February. </p>
