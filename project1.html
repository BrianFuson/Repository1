    <h3>Ball Players on Stage</h3>
    <p>This project was the final project for GRDS 355. My class was approached by the University of Tennessee Press and asked to create a book cover for Travis Stern's Ball Players on Stage. The 18 submissions were then judged and the one picked would be published. Mine was selected and this book is set to publish on soon. During my drafting process, I explored two main styles. One utilizes bright colors and motifs from baseball cards and theater and the other uses imagery of the five baseball players spoke on in the book paired with hand drawn ornamentation to create a newspaper effect. I ended up going with the bright and colorful version. I wanted to create a modern take on an old classic with this iteration. Baseball cards from the 1910's used imperfect typography as it was done by hand, so I wrote out the title to recreate this effect. </p>
